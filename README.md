👋 Hi there! I'm a Mechatronics Engineering graduate, soon to be officially titled, with a strong focus on embedded systems, IoT, and full-stack software development. I'm passionate about building tech solutions that combine hardware and software to solve real-world problems.

💻 I've worked on projects involving microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi, MQTT protocol, and full-stack web development using Python, Flask, FastAPI, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m currently part of a team developing a platform for secure mobile device exchanges, and I’m constantly looking to expand my knowledge.

🌱 Currently learning:
- Android app development (using Android Studio and Kotlin).
- Hardware-to-web service integration.
- Best practices for security in distributed systems.
  
🤝 Looking to collaborate on:
- Software development for embedded systems.
- Firmware projects for mobile phones:
  My goal is to learn, gain hands-on experience, and contribute with my current skills.

🔭 I’m currently working in proyect with some friends called TechExchange.

📄 Know about my experiences <a href="#">Resume</a>.

💬 Ask me about:
IoT, Python, microcontrollers, Flask/FastAPI backend development, hardware-software integration, and how to get started in embedded systems.

🚀 Outside of coding, I’m deeply interested in mobile phones, their operating systems, and how they connect to the physical world. I also enjoy sharing what I learn, solving technical challenges, and exploring new ideas.
